# -LIVER-PATIENT-ANALYSIS
# Objectives of Research
In India, delayed diagnosis of diseases is a fundamental problem due to a shortage of medical professionals. A typical scenario, prevalent mostly in rural and somewhat in urban areas is:

A patient going to a doctor with certain symptoms.

1.The doctor recommending certain tests like blood test, urine test etc depending on the symptoms.

2.The patient taking the aforementioned tests in an analysis lab.

3.The patient taking the reports back to the reports back to the hospital, where they are examined and the disease is identified.

This project aims to reduce the time delay caused due to the unnecessary back and forth shuttling between the hospital and the pathology lab. Here a machine
learning algorithm will be trained to predict a liver disease in patients using a data-set collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India.


# Problem Statement

The problem statement is formally defined as: â€˜Given a dataset containing various attributes of 584 Indian patients, use the features available in the dataset and define a supervised classification algorithm which can identify whether a person is suffering from liver disease or not. This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non- liver patient records.The data set was collected from north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records. Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90"

# Context

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.
